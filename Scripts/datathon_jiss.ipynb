We experimented with a variety of ways to process the data, mainly due to the issue of large amounts of 'na's being found within. One of the methods implemented was replacing all entries of 'na' with -1 , we also tried dropping all columns above a certain 'na' threshold. In the end we found that a threshold of 79% resulted in the highest score. This threshold was decided based on sensors 41, 42, and 43 being sequential while also having a similar amount of 'na' percentage, around 80%.\n\nWe attempted a few methods of normalization within the data, such as standard and robust normalization. They were implemented using the standard scikit library functions StandardScaler and RobustScaler. However, we found that normalizing the data resulted in lower accuracy."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nimport os\nprint(os.getcwd())\n# os.chdir(\"../input/TAMU_Datathon/\")\nfrom sklearn.feature_selection import RFECV\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import StratifiedKFold\nfrom sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier\n# from sklearn.ensemble import AdaBoostClassifier\nfrom sklearn import svm\n# from sklearn import neighbors\nfrom sklearn.metrics import f1_score\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport collections\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\ntraining_data = os.path.join(os.getcwd(), \"tamu-datathon/equip_failures_training_neg_one.csv\")\ntest_data = os.path.join(os.getcwd(), \"tamu-datathon/equip_failures_test_set.csv\")\ntraining_data_cleaned = os.path.join(os.getcwd(), 'tamu-datathon/equip_failures_train_clean_drop_79.csv')\ntest_data_cleaned = os.path.join(os.getcwd(), 'tamu-datathon/equip_failures_test_clean_drop_79.csv')\n\n\ndef clean_data(df_clean):\n    df_train = pd.read_csv(settings.training_data)\n    df_test = pd.read_csv(settings.test_data)\n    d1, d2 = clean_data(df_train, df_test)\n    d1.to_csv(training_data_cleaned, index = False)\n    d2.to_csv(test_data_cleaned, index = False)\n\n# Clean Data\n# clean_data(training_data)","execution_count":16,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","text":"/kaggle/input\n","name":"stdout"}]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Another technique we attempted was non-negative matrix factorization.
